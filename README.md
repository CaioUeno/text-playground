# Text Playground

This repository contains some different NLP tasks and algorithms/approaches to solve them. The idea behind is to concentrate plug-and-play solutions (because I'm lazy). Also, I will try to implement the same model in different frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow, Spacy, ...).

## Classification

## Entailment

## Named Entity Recognition
